## Inspiration
I had a long layover (20+ hours) in Reykjav√≠k, Iceland and ended up exploring the area. I rented a car, visited hot springs, the scenic landscapes, and local attractions. The reason I chose this flight was due to its very low fairs (was a college student back then), but the exploration was an unforseen bonus. What if we made a site to help travelers deliberately find long layovers (10+ hours) AND attractions once there?

## What it does
Finds flights with long layovers (10 or more hours) and activities in the city with the layover. This give enough time to explore a new city and get a cheaper flight without the bordem of waiting for your next flight. 

## How we built it
Using NodeJS and Express on the back-end for API calls (REST API), and MomentJS for calculating time differences. ReactJS on the front-end for the interface.

## Challenges we ran into
Deciding the scope of the MVP, parsing through API data, understanding how to implement both APIs in our project. Implementing Flexbox CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully finding all the long layovers between two given cities.

## What we learned
How to implement the Amadeus, Yelp, and Unsplash APIs, Flexbox.

## What's next for Delight
Round Trip Flights, and a way to partner with local businesses to give discount on the travelers.
